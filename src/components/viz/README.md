## @xstate/viz

This is copied and butchered from the WIP @xstate/viz package, which will eventually provide a proper visualiser component, which is just what we need. Right now it's not been released, and is just sitting on [the viz branch](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/tree/viz) of Xstate, and doesn't seem to work properly, but I thought it worth copying over to give it a try.
