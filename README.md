# gatsby-state-viz

This is a POC to show visualisation of the Gatsby develop state machine. This hasn't been released yet, so for it to work you'll need the `feat/state-machine` branch of Gatsby.

Currently this connects to a hard-coded port, so you can only run one site at a time.

To run, run `yarn`, then `gatsby develop`
